# Bulldozer Price Prediction – End-to-End Regression Project

This repository contains a complete end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting the sale price of bulldozers using historical data provided by Kaggle. The dataset includes rich features describing bulldozer usage, model characteristics, and sales dates.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust regression model that can predict bulldozer sale prices based on various machine attributes and usage data. This is a typical supervised learning problem, and we approach it by using industry-standard steps: data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment preparation.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `end-end-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory to store input datasets (train.csv, Valid.csv, Test.csv).
- `models/`: Directory to store trained model files (optional).
- `images/`: Directory to save generated plots and visualizations (optional).

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Notebook

- **Data Loading & Exploration**: Inspection of missing values, data types, and target distribution.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating datetime features, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.
- **Modeling**: Using `RandomForestRegressor` from scikit-learn to train and evaluate the model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting model parameters to improve accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as MAE and R² Score to assess performance on validation data.
